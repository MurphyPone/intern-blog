# Chemicals and Fruit by the Foot
Suppose that an individual consumes random combinations and quantities of chemical substances which are known to react with each other to form solid particulates inside the $\text {tummy}$.  Suppose that same individual has unfettered access to Fruit by the Foot.

You may see where this is going –as well as is chemical pseudo-impossibility– but bear with me.

If, before the Turing Tummy Test Tube poisons himself, he is consumes the perfect mixture of of chemicals to synthesize a metallic alloy that A) does not rupture his internal organs do to heat generation and B) reacts in such an interaction with his tummy-tum-tum that a tape could be passed through the metallic formation, then I dare say we may have a Tummy Turing Machine on our hands!

A [cursory look](http://bfy.tw/OA1z) at a list of toxic chemical compounds indicates that this means of creating a Turing Machine is _pretty_ terrible!

$\text {2H} \scriptstyle 2$ $\text { (g)} + \text {O} \scriptstyle 2$ $\text { (g)} \longrightarrow $ $\text {2H} \scriptstyle 2$ $\text {O (g)}$

$\Delta \text {H} = −483.6 \text { kJ/mol of O} \scriptstyle 2$ $\longrightarrow \xcancel{alive}$

However, if we were to luck out (something that is excruciatingly necessary for many of these methods), and were then able to pass Fruit by the Foot through the esophagus, and down through the metallic Turing chassis - all we would need to accomplish at this point would be a means of reading and writing to the strip.

Luckily for us, Fruit Roll-ups have been developed with literacy in mind.  Rather than writing from the Turing Machine to the tape, we could instead perform an inverse process to achieve a similar output; by writing from the Tattooed Fruit Roll-up to our Turing Machine (erasing, rather than writing) we could achieve a functionally identical means of read/writing.  

# A Question of Memory...

Although we lack the means of writing to our "tape," the aforementioned unfettered access will allow us to simply override necessary computational values to memory further down the line.  With each instruction to read/write/access our tape, we must append another command to duplicate this command at a given address a necessarily large distance down the fruit by the foot before returning to the initially specific address.  

I really don't know how this means of usurping read/erase-only memory access would happen without memory... But I'm fairly certain it is possible, and is therefore left as an exercise for the reader.

If one manages to survive the self-induced poisoning (in the name of science!), and overcome this puzzle of writing to a Fruit Roll-up with no means of _writing_ then that person would have discovered a Truly Terrible way of making a Turing Machine.
