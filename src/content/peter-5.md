# Rube Goldberg

A shit poster of some renown - the American cartoonist Reuben Goldberg was known for his intricate and convoluted blueprints for elaborate gadgets that ultimately accomplished nothing.  Famous in his own life, the illustrative genius pioneered an entire genre of entertainment focused on _pursuing the most roundabout or unnecessarily difficult means of achieving something_.

Before we become overwhelmed by the isomorphic rabbit hole which beckons us from the crest of next week, I thought that it would be fun to momentarily diverge from and indulge in a sillier Thuring Thought experimenth.

# The Machine
The year is 1955.

$\text {Suppose }$ that a tennis ball rests atop a hill looking down upon rural San Francisco.  A gust of wind rocks the ball forward, ever so slightly, causing a single domino to topple over.  Immediately adjacent to the falling domino lies another, and another, and another!  Spiraling all the way down the hill, dominoes coil around the underbrush, constricting the non-Turing Complete organic matter.  For twenty-two and a quarter days, the dominoes clink into one another.  And only once did the next domino not fall over when it was supposed to causing our unnamed observer to dash from his cover and resume the process!

Once the last domino topples over barrier separating desolate soil from smoothly paved concrete, it lands on a scale, attached to which is a string stretching upwards and over a house, through a complex pulley system that has been fully containerized such that if the string breaks free from any one pulley, another will immediately get shuffled into place to catch it.  

After the domino comes to rest on the scale, the rope is tugged just enough to cause a thunderous ***T W A N G*** to be heard from the back yard.  As our third-party observer scrambles to race around to the back, more mechanical whirring and clicking can be heard as a tesseract of levers, string-pulley systems, dominos, actual bells & whistles, and catapults manufactured out of commonplace silverware.
