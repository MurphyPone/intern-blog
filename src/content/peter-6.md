## The Infinite Properties of Physical Displacement

The inevitable movement that transpires through popcorn kernels when heated to the temperature of 100 ÂºC, causing them to * pop * contains several observable and, more importantly, measurable properties.

From the the simple scalar values alone, we can appreciate displacement, speed, surface area, weight.  Accounting for the vectors: velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, and angular acceleration.  

Suppose we were to pair the displacement $x$ before and after the popping of the kernel, along with the angular acceleration vector $\alpha$.  There exist sufficient permutations of the infinite combinations of these two values that we could isomorphically map each value and furthermore each combination to functions of a Turing Machine.  For example, a displacement of 0.14 meters and an angular acceleration $\alpha$ at time $t$ could be associated with the Turing commands "Left 1, Write B1:0x00f8a."  


Although the domain of displacement values and angular acceleration vectors is relatively limited due to the maximum limits of values achievable only by heating kernels, there exists sufficient values and combinations that we can assert that, no matter how terrible, popcorn is Turing Complete.
