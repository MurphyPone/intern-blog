# The Tornado
According to the [Fujita scale](http://www.tornadoproject.com/cellar/fscale.htm), no matter how unlikely, it is not impossible for an F6 "Inconceivable Tornado," whose wind speeds could reach up to 379 mph, to produce fast enough bouts that the small area affected, along with the mess produced by the underlying F4 and F5 winds, would be irrecognizable.

Whereas commonsense would immediately draw one's mind towards the destruction caused by the "missiles," –namely cars, refrigerators, lamp posts, etc.– I'd beg the reader to consider the creative possibilities of the high-speed winds.  This is not to put to downplay the ultimately destructive capacities of such a natural disaster - rather a contemplation of the pseudo-impossible.  While F6 hurricanes are dubbed "inconceivable," it is not inconceivable for an arbitrarily long, dare I say...infinitely long? tape, along with various mechanical components to be forced together by the violent winds in such a way that the resulting mass could imitate the functions of a Turing machine?

Perhaps it is, but humor me.

This would be, without a doubt, one of the worst ways to go about assembling a Turing Machine - beat out in this manner perhaps only by its cousin, the hurricane.

# The Hurricane
Operating on a separate scale to measure wind speeds known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SHSS), hurricanes achieve markedly-lower wind speeds than their landlocked counter parts.  That being said, there is no objective "minimum Turing velocity" needed to achieve the assembly described above.  We merely assume that the higher the velocity, the more chaotic the movement of the shrapnel.  The more chaotic the movement, the more difficult it is to disprove that such a pattern that would construct a Turing Machine would be impossible to achieve.  

With this artificial constaint of hurricane wind-speeds in mind, we can note that, according to the [National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php), a Category 5 hurricane is defined as exhibiting sustained wind speeds of 157 mph or higher (note that the keyword "higher" allows us to benefit from equal amounts of entropic infallibility as the argument made for Tordnado Turing Machines).  Quite high speeds indeed.

However, this method of assembling Turing Machines is _even_ worse than relying upon a tornado as, even if the winds do somehow manage to spin together a Turing Machine, the damned thing would get soiled in minutes by the accompanying torrential water forces inherent to hurricanes!      

# Conclusion
I assert with some degree of confidence that relying upon this natural disasters is a terrible way of making a Turing Machine.
