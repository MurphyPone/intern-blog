This was a long journey, but I dont remember much. These are the only surviving records. So in the words of my personal idol, Charlie Day, wild card bitches. Yeeeeeeee haw</p>\n<p>These are the ingredients. You need ingredients to make food, including sushi\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fVex6TN.jpg\" alt=\"Imgur\"></p>\n<p>This is me holding the sesame seeds I used. I liked the sesame seeds a lot, so I sent this picture to my mom\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zgTdtv5.jpg\" alt=\"Imgur\"></p>\n<p>I'm rolling the sushi in this photo. I started off rolling away from my body cause I sucked, but now I'm a big pro and know to roll <em>towards</em> my body. Food is like Britney Spears. You may be toxic, but if you pull it towards you then it can't help but go along with your plans. The sushi rools call me a taste of a poison paradise for a reason. Because I eat them. Yum\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E5G36Bg.jpg\" alt=\"Imgur\"></p>\n<p>This is all the sushi. Well, not all of it. The ends of each roll looked pretty fucking ugly, so I didn't put them on the plate. Now they're in some old tupperware container where they belong, those sick fucks\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BMXJL6E.jpg\" alt=\"Imgur\"></p>\n<p>This is me with the sushi in my mouth. I enjoyed eating the sushi. It was nutritious and appetizing\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pkaQLQw.jpg\" alt=\"Imgur\"></p>\n<h3>BONUS FOOTAGE</h3>\n<p>Wow do I sure have a surprise for you. Bonus footage! Idk why there's no audio. Imgur is weird like that. But hey at least you get to see me make my sushi. There are starving kids in Africa who don't even have food, so don't complain about the lack of audio, you privileged snob</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/AEPAMt9.mp4\">Part 1</a>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4FGaUaS.mp4\">Part 2</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"13 July, 2019","path":"/blog/sushi","title":"BHoag Makes Sushi","author":"Asian version of Brady"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
